# Anki Jouyou Kanji (常用漢字) Tags 
### About
An Anki plugin for Japanese learning that maintains tags for each word's Jouyou grade levels.


This plugin automatically tags new notes with the grade levels of kanji used in its main field.
It also adds a new option in the tool tab:
**Apply Jouyou Grade Tags**. Applying Jouyou tags in this manner will:

- Tag all notes in a deck with their grade levels
- Remove any grade level tags which no longer reflect the content of the card

### Advantages in Japanese Learning
Each kanji in the Jouyou list is taught in a particular grade level in the Japanese school system.
Ranging from grades 1-6, and S, indicating it is taught in secondary school. Media targeted to specific age ranges will often substitute kanji
beyond the audience's academic level for kana, or annotate the kanji with furigana. Knowing this, literacy in pre-highschool texts such as
shounen manga can be achieved faster by focusing on the kanji likely to appear in it. Modifying notes containing advanced kanji may help you
accomplish this.

### Configuring this plugin
Like most addons, configuration options exist in **Tools -> Addons**.
"Deck" selects the deck you wish to be tagged by selecting **Apply Jouyou Grade Tags** from the Tools menu.
"Field" indicates the name of the field which the plugin should use to determine the grade levels of the note.
